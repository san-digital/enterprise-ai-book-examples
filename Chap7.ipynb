      "While AI can indeed provide useful suggestions based on dietary needs or available ingredients, the decision about what to eat for dinner should ultimately be a human one. Food is not only a source of sustenance, but it's deeply tied to our emotions, culture, and personal preferences ‚Äì nuances that AI cannot fully grasp.

While acknowledging the potential utility of AI, they emphasise the deeply personal nature of food and meal choices, a nuance that may not be fully captured by AI.
